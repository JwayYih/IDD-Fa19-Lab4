## Part B. Actuating Servo motors

### Part 1. Connect the Servo to your breadboard

**a. Which color wires correspond to power, ground and signal?**

Green ground, red red is power, orange is signal

### Part 2. Connect the Servo to your Arduino

**a. Which Arduino pin should the signal line of the servo be attached to?**

Pin 9

**b. What aspects of the Servo code control angle or speed?**

pos<= controls the max angle
delay controls the speed

## Part C. Integrating input and output

**Include a photo/movie of your raw circuit in action.**
